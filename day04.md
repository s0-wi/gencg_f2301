# Day 04 - Machines

I was thinking about the asignment and how the act of drawing could questioned or rethought. I first just wanted to make a simple drawing machine with transparency changing at random. But then I had to think of sketches that I have seen that have been made out of hundreds of ellipsis drawn on a line.

Making this would be quite easy, so I wanted to make it with some kind of special vertex. I copied the vertex from this little wobbly thing I made in a class at the HKB BFH.

So one of these vertexes will be now redrawn every frame. I also added some "delay" to the "snake" following the curser because I liked how it felt.
I saw that sometimes a thin line is recognizable, which to me seemed like an error. I tried different ways of "closing" the shape but that didn't change.
I then started experimenting with transparency of the line, the strokesize and the amount the vertex would change. I added keys to change the parameters, try out the qwertz keys to change the pattern.

On this day I advanced faster then the other days because I could build upon previous knowledge and use old code of mine.
