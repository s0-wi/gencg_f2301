# Day 06 - Stray From the Path

This day I decided to just have some fun, after the more serious week.
After the input I read through the curriculum but then decided to just work a bit with my favorite exercise from last week: the drawing machine.

After playing around with it for a while I had the urge to do some typographic work, and since there was no day in the plan of this course, I spontaneously decided to start with this today.

Some variations that I made on that day include:

Don't panic! A mouse lerping text that draws a pink smoke behind it.

A colorchanging letter that meanders on its own.
