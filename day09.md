# Day 09 - Typo and Travel Day

While traveling across France I spent my time staring into this screen.
While researching some typographic stuff I stumpled over Andre Burnier's creations which while looking pretty simple I still found very interesting.

It took me quite a bit of research to find the ways and functions to make the sillouette of the letters into points which seems to be the way Andre's animations are working.

I started with a little thing which draws rectangles on these points. I then connected one side length to the mouse motion and rotation of these rectangles to the other axis.

With my last atempt I tried to do a similar effect to the one in the video with the sand cleaning machine above.
I tried to load dunes/sand fotos from unsplash and then wrote a function which takes the most right pixel of some rows in the middle and then fills the whole row with that color.
This was only the start of this attempt.
It was very humbling to see that I somehow deleted this code and couldn't find it anymore. On the last day of the course I learn the painful way how import it is to understand the tools you use and how important it is to have a folder-structure that makes sense.
